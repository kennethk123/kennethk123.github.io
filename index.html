    <p style="color:white;">Name: Kenneth Kristopher Chang</p>
    <p style="color:white;">Student id: s3669227</p>
    <p style="color:white;">Email: s3669227@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">My name is kenneth I am 18-year-old and my nationality is Indonesian. I have been staying in<br>Melbourne for about 2 years doing my foundation and bachelor’s degree. My mother language is<br>Bahasa Indonesia, but I can speak English and a little bit of Chinese. My hobby is playing sports such<br>as badminton, basketball, and football. I also enjoy playing games such as NBA, FIFA, and much more.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Interest in IT</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">I am interested in IT in general but if I must choose a specific thing it would be cyber security. My<br>interest with technology started since I’m young as I enjoy messing with my computer, tv and such.<br>The thing that really sparked my interest is the fact that technology is the future and people that<br>doesn’t know anything about the digital world will have a hard time surviving. I have quite a few<br>experiences on IT such as programming, console.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Why I choose RMIT as my university</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">The reason why I choose RMIT is because it’s one of the most prestigious school in Melbourne and<br>RMIT is good for its information technology. RMIT also provides good environment for student to<br>learn in. It is also located strategically in the middle of Melbourne CBD, so I don’t have to travel far<br>from my apartment to the university. Before coming to Melbourne, I asked a lot of people’s opinion<br>on which school is the best for me to attend and majority says RMIT.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">What i expect to learn in RMIT</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">I expect to learn IT at a level where I can find jobs in the future. As I am planning to be a cyber<br>security analyst, I expect to learn most or everything that can be taught at RMIT. I also expect to<br>learn how to work well with everyone no matter the race or age. Learning responsibilities is a plus as<br>we will be held responsible for a lot of things in the future.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Ideal job</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38566423?searchrequesttoken=7de382a6-769c-4d64-9631-0c4c5a0cb270&type=standard">Ideal job link</a>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Why is this job appealing to me</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">This job will ask us to help the IT security manager to manage Toyota’s security by analyzing<br>vulnerabilities and threats and deal with them accordingly. This position is appealing for me because<br>Toyota is considered a big brand and I can expect good pay while knowing that there won’t be<br>discrimination there.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Skills, qualification and experience required</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">This job will acquire us to have couple years of experience in the security industry. We also need to<br>be able to understand threat, malware and network traffic and deal with them accordingly. Working<br>with the team is also needed as most of the work will involve us working as a group. Strong<br>background on networking, systems, virtualization, scripting language, and cloud platforms.<br>I have little to no experience working as a cyber security analyst, but I have been learning cyber<br>security stuff such as encryption, threats of cyber security and how to deal with them.<br>I am now lacking in a lot of skills and experience, but I plan to join cyber security seminars whenever<br>I have free time and keep on watching cyber security videos so that I can have a better understanding on the field.<br>I also plan to learn programming on a basic level as it will help me understand cyber security better.<br>If I have the chance, I would like to be able to experience working as a cyber security analyst so that I won’t be surprised in the future.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Personal Profile</h2>

    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">Myers-Briggs test</p>
    <img src="learn.jpg" alt="Learning test" width="900" height="200">
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">Learning style test</p>
    <img src="iq.jpg" alt="IQ test" width="500" height="500">
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">IQ Test</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">What do these tests means to me</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">The test result can give us a general idea of who we are. For the Myers-Briggs test, it shows that I am<br>“The logician” which means that I like to have debate in my head which is true. The logician is also<br>shy to people who they are not familiar with but once they are familiar with the person, they<br>become friendly which is very true to me. Some of the description is wrong but most of it are<br>correct. So, test like the Myers-Briggs and learning style is correct to an extent but it should just be<br>taken with a grain of salt.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">How will this tests influence my behaviour with the team</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">The results will not influence me as I will always try my best to cooperate with my groupmates no<br>matter who it is. This kind of thinking have always been very successful to me as my groupmates will<br>also appreciate my effort even though we have different ideas or working styles.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">How should you use this tests when forming a team</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">When forming a team, I would pick people who is like me so that we would spend less time arguing<br>and more time working which produce better result. I would also pick people who are not lazy and<br>do their work on time so that there will not be a problem inside the group.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Project Ideas</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">Security have always been a problem to deal with when creating a program. Usually when<br>people create a program, they embed the security at the end of the production cycle. This means<br>that if there are problems with the security, significant changes need to be made which cause delays<br>in production. Therefore, I want to create automated security testing (AST) so that people and<br>businesses can embed their security at all stages of production. To achieve this, I will be making<br>automated security testing by implementing DevSecOps.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">What motivate me to do this</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">There are various reasons as why I want to do automated security testing as my project. The<br>first reason is because security is very important to companies and there are many apps that provide<br>good security such as Avast antivirus, Kaspersky, VPNs and much more, but apps that embed<br>security at all stages of production are lacking. Therefore, I want to do automated security testing so<br>that companies don’t have to delay their production which can cost a lot to businesses. The other<br>reason is because cyber security attacks has been happening more frequently throughout the year.<br>According to OTA’s Cyber incident & breach trends report the reported number of cyber-attacks in<br>2017 is 160000 which nearly doubles that of 2016 which is reported to be 82000 attacks. Another<br>report shows that only 13% of companies uses automated security testing. The number of hacking<br>will keep on rising throughout the year and automated security testing can minimize the attacks.<br>Another reason why I want to use DevSecOps is because most people don’t care about security<br>when creating software as they believe that it will only slow them down which makes them unable<br>to be ahead of the competitions. DevSecOps is made to change this.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">How to create automated security testing</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">As I said earlier, I will be implementing DevSecOps to my automated security testing. The<br> purpose of implementing DevSecOps is so that everyone that is included in the development life<br>cycle is responsible for security.DevSecOps brings operation and development together with security functions by being able<br>to embed security at the early stages rather than the end. This ensures that no major changes<br>needed to be made if there is a problem with the security in the program. DevSecOps work by<br>breaking software into smaller steps. Therefore, businesses should use the automated security testing<br>by testing piece by piece starting with the smallest ones first and as the automated security testing<br>develop link them into larger builds that can automate smaller jobs in the product.<br>This also gives time for people to adjust to the automated security testing. Automated testing is<br>used at all part of the production cycle to make sure that the software is working as intended.<br>Automated testing will guarantee that the software is not malicious when operating.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Primary areas of security testing</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">There are a lot of areas in automated security testing, but this are the primary areas of security<br> testing. The first is application security testing. Application security testing scan the software as it is<br>being run and ensure that there are no malicious actions. You can use tools such as burp intruder<br>and OWASP Zap automation to test application and make sure that it will not be perceived as<br>malicious by users. The second is scanning for appropriate configurations. Software tools can be<br>used to set up applications correctly and securely. An example is the Microsoft Azure Advisor tool<br>used for cloud-based infrastructure. The automated testing tools are usually designed to operate in<br>certain environments, such as web-based environment or mobile environment. So, during the<br>developing stages of the software, it can be ensured that the software is being made accordingly.<br> The third is code analysis. Code analysis tools can enhance DevOps security by scanning the code<br>and determining the vulnerabilities within the code. The tools that can be used for these<br>are Veracode and RIPS Technologies.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Tools and technology required</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">There are 2 choices to be made when wanting to automate security testing. The first is open source<br>and the second is commercial automation testing tools. Open source tools are more affordable,<br>robust and well build while commercial have more advance technology and better customer service.<br>
    Examples of open source is BDD Security. BDD security is a security testing framework that uses<br>natural language to describe security function as features. Another example is Selenium which test<br>web application across different platforms. An example of commercial automation is burp intruder.<br>Burp intruder is a scanner that ensure applications are interacting well with the environment.<br>Another example is Ranorex which is designed to be used for desktop and mobile testing. With my<br>project, I will use open source so that it will be cheaper and is more future proof than commercial automation.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Skills required</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">DevSecOps require a broad set of skills. They need the knowledge of an IT security as well as<br>understandings of DevOps. The first skill that is required is the understanding of DevOps and its<br>principles. This is very important as we are adding security to DevOps which means that if we don’t<br>understand DevOps, we will not be able to integrate the security to it. The second skill required is<br>being able to use programming language such as Python, Java, PHP, Perl and Ruby. This is because<br>we will try to implement security while developing the software which means that we must at least<br>understand the basic of programming. Knowledge of threat modelling, risk assessment and<br>cybersecurity threat are needed as different software needs different protection. Last is being able<br>to understand programs such as Puppet, Chef, ThreatModeler, Checkmarx, Immunio and Aqua.<br>This programs are essential to execute DevSecOps.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="font-size:110%;color:white;">If this project were to be successful, businesses will no longer ignore security and view it as a<br>hindrance as everything will be automated from the beginning of the development to the end. This<br>project will also decrease the number of cyber attacks on companies as it will always check<br>problem in the software without fail.</p>
